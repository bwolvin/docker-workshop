# Docker Workshop

This workshop demonstrates how to use docker to run containerized environments

## Excercise

While the full solution is found in `master`, checking out the `workshop` branch in this repository will set the repo to a state before all the logic is in place. The goal of the workshop is to teach the user to use Docker for developing, shipping, and running applications.

### Tasks

- Get a Node.js application to run inside a Docker container

- Extend Dockerfile to add ARG and ENV options

- Covert Dockerfile into docker-compose file
